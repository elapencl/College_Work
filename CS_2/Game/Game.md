Over the last few weeks of the semester you will work as part of a team of 3-4 students to complete a project. I will assign the teams based on grades so far to avoid vast discrepancies in preparedness. You have considerable freedom in choosing a topic, though you must get my approval.

If, like many teams, you choose to write a game, here is some advice:
Consider implementing Fortress  download, which was created by a local designer who contacted me. I'd love to be able to give them a couple implementations of their game.
Use an existing game. Designing a new game that is entertaining and not horribly unbalanced is extremely difficult. Two useful lists to browse through are Wikipedia's list of puzzle video games (Links to an external site.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_puzzle_video_games and BoardGameGeek's list of abstract strategy games (Links to an external site.) https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1009/abstract-strategy#linkeditems (sort by "Num Ratings" to find the most popular ones).
Use a relatively simple game.
Things get much more complicated if either space or time are continuous (as opposed to discrete).
Use a game that plays relatively quickly -- 5 to 10 minutes. Longer games are hard to test.
Favor two-player games or one-player puzzles for the same reason.
Avoid games where information is hidden from some of the players but not others, such as Poker. In a computer implementation of such a game, either some players must look away from the screen (which is awkward), you must provide an artificially intelligent opponent (difficult), or you must network the game (also difficult).
 
Again, you are not required to choose a game. If you want to solve a problem for some other class or organization, go ahead (pending my approval). Do what inspires you!
 
The first document you'll produce is your problem specification and design. This should be 2-3 pages long. Answer the following questions:
 
What is your project?
What are the rules of your game, simulation, etc.? Diagrams can be extremely helpful here. Either link to an existing explanation or explain the rules clearly in your own words. Simply copying and pasting others' work (rules, images, etc.) without citation is plagiarism and unacceptable!
What will the user's experience be like when they use your program? What will they see on the screen, what buttons or keys will they press, and how will the program react?
Include at least one detailed illustration of what the program screen will look like in action.
What parts of the program do you think will be most difficult?
What do you expect to accomplish during each of the two subsequent versions of the project?
How will you break your program into classes? You will need at least three: the GUI, the logical model, and a test for the logical model; depending on the project you may need more.
List at least five early tests you plan to write as you start developing your game. These should be clear and specific enough that you'll be able to express them as JUnit tests. "Moving to a space beyond the edge of the board is illegal" is better than "only legal moves are accepted".

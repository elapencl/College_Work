This is a pair programming project. Work with your assigned partner. Only one of you has to turn it in, but make sure you don't both think the other one was doing it.

Overview
Implement Schelling's model of segregation, as described in Frank McCown's assignment (Links to an external site.).

Your program should behave like the example embedded in the web page above. Use the same default parameters (e.g., the grid is 30x30).

You don't have to provide buttons or sliders. I should be able to change each parameter by changing it in one place in your main method.

You don't have to implement any variants, just the basic version.

Use test-driven development.

What To Hand In
Hand in your main program Segregation.java and your test class SegregationTest.java.

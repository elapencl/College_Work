This assignment is meant to give you practice defining objects.

You will define two classes:

Vector, which has instance variables x and y
Starship, which has instance variables name, position, and velocity
Each class should be written in proper object-oriented style, including:

Private instance variables and public methods
One or more constructors
Getters and (for Vector) setters
toString and equals methods
any other methods required by the tests (below)
a Javadoc comment before each method
The specification for these classes is given in the form of two JUnit test classes, VectorTest.java  downloadand StarshipTest.java  download. You'll have to examine these to determine what methods you need and what they're supposed to do.

Note that there is no main program to run here. You're just defining classes that might be used in other programs, such as games or control systems for actual spacecraft. Don't worry, it's just rocket science!

Hints
Make sure Vector is finished (passing all tests) before starting on Starship.

For each class, first write enough of the class so that the test compiles. Methods don't have to do anything yet; leave them empty or with return null; or return -1; if their return type is not void. Once you can run the tests, work though the tests in the order they appear in the test file, doing whatever is necessary to pass each one.

If you know how to use IntelliJ's automatic code generation you can save a great deal of typing.

There are no loops or recursion required to complete these classes; if you're using those, you're working too hard.

What To Hand In
Hand in your classes Vector.java and Starship.java.

This assignment is meant to give you some practice writing methods that deal with arrays.

Once your IntelliJ project is set up for JUnit, download the following files:

Put LinearAlgebra.java  downloadin your src folder.
Put LinearAlgebraTest.java  downloadin your test folder.
You should now be able to run the tests. 12 should fail and 8 should pass (because those 8 are just verify that your methods don't do certain things).

Work your way through LinearAlgebra.java, completing each method so that it passes the two associated tests.

Hints
Don't modify LinearAlgebraTest.java.

Each method has a return statement put there just so that the code compiles. Replace that with your own code (which will include some kind of return statement).

Looking at the tests might give you a hint as to what the code is supposed to do.

What To Hand In
Hand in your version of LinearAlgebra.java.

			<br>A free bird leaps
			<br>on the back of the wind
			<br>and floats downstream
			<br>till the current ends
			<br>and dips his wng
			<br>in the orange sun rays
			<br>and dares to claim the sky.
		</p>

		<p style="color:darkgreen">
			<br>But a bird that stalks
			<br>down his narrow cage
			<br>can seldom see through
			<br>his bars of rage
			<br>his wings are clipped and
			<br>his feet are tied
			<br>so he opens his throat to sing.
		</p>

		<p style="color:darkgreen">
			<br>The caged bird sings
			<br>with a fearful trill
			<br>of things unknown
			<br>but longed for still
			<br>and his tune is hears
			<br>on the distant hill
			<br>for the caged bird
			<br>sings of freedom.
		</p>

		<p style="color:darkgreen">
			<br>The free bird thinks of another breeze
			<br>and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
			<br>and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
			<br>and he names the sky how own
		</p>

		<p style="color:darkgreen">
			<br>But a caged bird stands on the gave of dreams
			<br>his shadow shouts on a nighmare scream
			<br>his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
			<br>so he open his throat to sing.

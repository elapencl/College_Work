This assignment involves data visualization using the matplotlib library. It gives you some room for creativity and lets you choose a subject that interests you.

Find a data set on some topic that interests you. A good source is the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. Your data set must:

Have at least 50 data points.
Have at least four attributes per data point, at least three of which must be numerical.
Not be the Iris or Titanic dataset (because we've already worked with those).
Using matplotlib, produce a nice plot of at least four attributes from your data. Since you can only use location on the screen to represent two attributes (or three if you look into 3D plotting), you'll need to use some other features such as different marks, color, or size.

Make sure you're doing everything listed in the rubric below.

What to Hand In
Hand in:

Any raw data file(s) your program needs to read
A single .py file that draws your plot
